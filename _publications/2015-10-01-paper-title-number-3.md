Social Media Analytics of User Evaluation for Innovative Digital Cultural and Creative Products: Experiences Regarding Dunhuang Cultural Heritage. ACM Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage, 17(3), 1-25. [https://doi.org/10.1145/3653307](https://doi.org/10.1145/3653307)


**Background:** This study provides insights into improving the user experience for researchers concentrating on cultural heritage education via digital cultural and creative products (CACPs).


**Purpose:** This paper offers insightful references for researchers and promoters in the digital cultural heritage preservation sector by analysing and contrasting cultural heritage preservation innovations from several angles. It also highlights the importance of education about cultural heritage.


**Methodology:** Python is implemented for web data mining, data analysis, Chinese natural language processing, text clustering and semantic social network analysis.


**Results:** Findings show that official media, museums, and social media influencers form part of the promotional elements, and users display a greater curiosity in the landscapes and user-generated content of interactive products. The study also came to the conclusion that various kinds of cultural and creative products can mix their benefits to complement each other, which delivers consumers a more complete awareness of cultural heritage and hence draws users to interact and use these products.
