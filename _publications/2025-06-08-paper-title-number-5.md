**Background:** Deepfake has great potential as an educational tool, but it also poses some ethical and technical challenges.

**Objective:** The purpose of this paper is to conduct an initial review of peer-reviewed literature that discusses the use of deepfakes in education. The purpose of this report is to summarize applications, risks, and countermeasures associated with deepfake technology in higher education.

**Methodology:** The literature for this study was systematically retrieved from the Scopus and Web of Science databases. The inclusion criteria for the literature were to consider research that explored the application of deepfakes in education and encoded them using an inductive/deductive approach.

**Implications:** This review examines the application of deepfake in various fields of education and how it can play a greater role in education by utilizing artificial intelligence technologies. This research contributes to educators' understanding of deepfakes and summarises how to avoid the risks associated with deepfakes.
